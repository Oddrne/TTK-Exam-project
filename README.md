Naturalistic stimuli such as movies elicit rich, time-varying patterns of brain activity that are not well captured by traditional static connectivity analyses. Emotional movie clips in particular drive complex and nonstationary neural responses, engaging distributed cortical and subcortical networks across multiple intrinsic timescales. Age-related changes in neural dynamics suggest that young and older adults may rely on different temporal modes when processing emotional content, but how these differences are expressed in large-scale connectivity remains incompletely understood.

Most functional connectivity studies based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) rely on band-pass filtering within a fixed frequency range (e.g., 0.01--0.1 Hz) followed by correlation or related measures between region-of-interest (ROI) time series. While effective for stationary or quasi-stationary signals, such approaches impose \emph{a priori} frequency boundaries and implicitly average over potentially distinct intrinsic timescales. In the context of naturalistic movie watching, where spectral content can vary over time and across individuals, fixed-band methods may obscure meaningful differences in how brain networks interact at slow versus fast fluctuations. 

Adaptive time--frequency methods provide an alternative framework for analyzing nonstationary, multicomponent signals such as BOLD fMRI time series. Techniques derived from the Hilbert--Huang Transform, including empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its multivariate extensions, decompose signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that represent narrow-band oscillatory components with well-defined instantaneous frequency. More recently, multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) has been proposed as a stable and computationally efficient approach to jointly extract frequency-aligned modes across multiple channels. By representing each ROI signal as a sum of intrinsic modes, these methods enable the estimation of \emph{timescale-specific} functional connectivity without predefined filter banks. 

In this paper, we investigate how intrinsic timescales shape large-scale functional connectivity during emotional movie watching in young and older adults. We use MVMD to decompose ROI-wise fMRI time series into a small set of shared intrinsic modes and compute functional connectivity separately for each mode. This yields a family of frequency-resolved connectivity matrices, allowing us to test whether age-related differences in connectivity are preferentially expressed at slow or fast intrinsic fluctuations. We further compare these multiscale results to conventional broadband connectivity, assessing the added value of adaptive decomposition. 

The main contributions of this work are: (i) we demonstrate the feasibility of applying MVMD to high-dimensional naturalistic fMRI data; (ii) we propose a simple pipeline for estimating timescale-specific functional connectivity from intrinsic modes; and (iii) we provide an initial exploration of age-dependent differences in multiscale connectivity during emotional movie viewing.
